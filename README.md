# Counter-Spy.ai v2.1: Adversary-Aware Prompt Firewall & Forwarding Gateway

Counter-Spy.ai is a secure GenAI control-plane for adversary-aware LLM governance. It is a policy-enforcing firewall first, with a forwarding path for clean traffic and a review/block path for suspicious traffic.

Counter-Spy.ai decouples adversarial defense from response generation by enforcing a control-plane architecture that mediates all LLM interactions before inference.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sanitized Pass-through Guarantee**: Only the redacted version of a prompt is ever sent to the inference engine. Raw PII and secrets are neutralized at the local sanitization layer before any external API call is initiated.

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Treat every prompt as untrusted input
- Enforce policy before model invocation
- Minimize data exposure via sanitization
- Separate control-plane (defense) from inference-plane (response)
- Maintain full auditability of all decisions

## 🛡️ Core Security Architecture

The application implements a **Defense-in-Depth** strategy for AI interactions:

### 1. Local Sanitization Pipeline (The Filter)
Before any prompt is sent to the AI model, it passes through a local TypeScript-based sanitization layer:
- **PII & Secret Redaction**: Automatically detects and masks emails, AWS keys, IP addresses, credit card patterns, phone numbers, and SSNs. It also redacts the actual values of secret keys and passwords.
- **Regex Detection**: Evaluates input against configurable regular expressions to catch sophisticated prompt injection and instruction bypass attempts. Supports `break-all` formatting for complex, lengthy patterns.
- **Normalization**: Flattens input (e.g., leetspeak conversion) to prevent keyword bypasses.
- **Obfuscation Detection**: Extends decode-and-inspect coverage beyond Base64 and Hex to include URL encoding, HTML entities, reverse text, ROT13-style masking, NATO phonetic and Morse encodings, recursive mixed transforms, structural wrappers such as end-sequence markers, chunked payloads, variable-expansion patterns, and vertical-text formatting, plus an English-likeness heuristic for alphabetic substitution gibberish that still looks like plain text.
- **Entropy Analysis (Sliding Window)**: Calculates Shannon entropy using a sliding window approach (35-character windows, 5-character steps) to detect localized high-entropy payloads (Base64, Hex, etc.) and prevent **Token Dilution** attacks.
  - **Math**: $$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)$$
  - **Global Entropy**: The average randomness across the entire prompt.
  - **Max Window Entropy**: The highest randomness found in any specific 35-character chunk. This defeats token dilution, where an attacker attempts to hide a high-entropy payload within paragraphs of normal, low-entropy text.
  - **Thresholds**: Entropy now follows one explicit governance policy across Analyst Chat, Playground, Audit Logs, and Metrics. Prompt entropy at or below `3.6` is treated as allowed on entropy grounds alone. Entropy above `3.6` and up to the configured `Entropy Threshold` is treated as `Suspicious`. Entropy above the configured threshold is treated as `Adversarial`.
- **Syntactic Complexity Analyzer**: Real-time detection of instruction stacking, probing, and model reverse engineering. 
  - **Logic**: Analyzes constraint density and special character ratios using an inverse match regex `/[a-zA-Z0-9\s]/g`. This captures code-like syntax and URL-encoded strings that attempt to bypass semantic filters.
  - Features analysis of sentence verbosity to flag highly complex, obfuscated prompts. Accessible via the Analyst Playground and integrated into the core firewall.
- **Keyword & Forbidden Phrase Filtering**: Matches input against configurable lists of blocked keywords and forbidden phrases. Today, `Forbidden Phrases` remains a normalized phrase-matching control rather than a standalone semantic classifier; semantic category steering is currently reinforced through the saved firewall prompt. The default blocklist also includes risky transport markers such as `javascript:` and `://`, and redacts policy-triggering script/URL payloads before they are persisted in audit detail views.
- **Anti-ReDoS Circuit Breaker**: Local sanitization execution time (`latencyMs`) is monitored via high-resolution timing. If a sanitization pass completes but exceeds 100ms, the triggering request is blocked before inference, logged as `Adversarial` with `ReDoS_ATTEMPT_DETECTED`, and an automatic Global System Pause is activated for subsequent traffic. This is a latency-based fail-secure verdict after sanitization returns, not a mid-execution process kill.
- **Persistent Preview**: Live sanitization results remain visible after execution as "Last Execution Results" until a new prompt is initiated.

### 2. Output Sanitization Layer (The Guard)
A secondary sanitization layer is applied to all LLM responses:
- **Keyword Redaction**: Scans the model's output and masks any blocked keywords or forbidden phrases with `[REDACTED_KEYWORD]`.
- **PII Leak Prevention**: Re-applies PII redaction to the model's response to prevent accidental data leakage.
- **Decision-First Severity**: Output-side keyword redaction is treated as display hygiene, not as an automatic severity escalation. Final audit severity follows the structured firewall decision contract when available.

### 3. Governance Engine
The system evaluates the sanitization results against active guardrails and provides real-time administrative controls:
- **Adversarial Interception**: If entropy rises above the configured `Entropy Threshold`, if syntactic complexity exceeds `90`, or if any recognized obfuscation signal is detected, the request is blocked pre-inference as `Adversarial`. Counter-Spy.ai now treats non-plain-text concealment as hostile by default, even if the decoded content is not yet a confirmed policy violation.
- **Suspicious Interception**: If entropy rises above `3.6` without exceeding the configured adversarial cutoff, or if blocked keywords, forbidden phrases, suspicious external-call attempts, or other supporting structural signals are detected, the request is blocked pre-inference as `Suspicious`.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Mode**: When activated, automatically intercepts borderline traffic using the live governance thresholds (default entropy threshold `4.0` as the adversarial cutoff, a fixed suspicious entropy floor at `3.6`, plus the active syntactic threshold) and routes it to a manual review queue (`PENDING_REVIEW`), allowing human analysts to intervene before the payload reaches the inference engine.
- **Forbidden Phrases Enforcement**: Operator-managed forbidden phrases are enforced deterministically through the sanitizer. The visible Firewall Prompt carries the recommended forbidden-category and gibberish/obfuscation guidance used by the safeguard judge, and the generated Safeguard Effective Prompt adds active phrase context plus the backend-owned JSON verdict contract.
- **Backend Error Boundary**: Backend-availability errors are reserved for prompts that were actually eligible for backend inference. Prompts already classified locally as `Suspicious` or `Adversarial` — including recognized obfuscation such as chunking, vertical text, leetspeak, ROT13, or similar concealment — should terminate in the local firewall path and not fall through to `/v1/intercept`.

### 4. Operator Controls
- **Governance Status**:
  - **ACTIVE (Green)**: All core guardrails are enabled.
  - **REDUCED (Orange)**: One or more critical guardrails (PII Redaction, Logging, Blocked Keywords, or Forbidden Phrases) are disabled.
  - **DISABLED (Red)**: All guardrails are disabled.
- **Traffic Provenance**: Audit logs preserve a `source` marker such as `analyst_chat` or `bulk_ingest`, so test traffic can be compared against analyst-entered traffic without hiding records from the main dashboards.
- **Global System Pause (DEFCON 1)**: A governance kill switch that prevents further automated inference while active. New Analyst Chat prompts are logged and routed to the manual review queue (`PENDING_REVIEW`) instead of reaching the downstream model. Bulk Ingest honors the same live switch by stopping the active replay loop when pause is initiated; remaining batch prompts are not automatically queued or sent until an operator resumes and starts a new ingest run. The triggering ReDoS request is blocked immediately; later analyst prompts are queued until operators resume service.

### 5. Inference Engine (Pluggable LLM Architecture)
- **Backend-Only Inference Path**: Direct browser-side model access is disabled so provider credentials are not exposed in the client bundle.
- **Authenticated Gateway Pattern**: Clean prompts are intended to flow through an authenticated backend gateway (`/v1/intercept`) before any external inference provider is called.
- **Vendor-Neutral Posture**: The control-plane is designed to stay decoupled from any single provider so the downstream inference engine can evolve across backend-managed OpenAI-compatible and future multi-model runtimes without exposing provider secrets to the browser.
- **Split Prompt Roles**: System configuration keeps a **Firewall Prompt** and a **Downstream Responder Prompt** distinct. The safeguard path uses one generated **Safeguard Effective Prompt** built from the visible Firewall Prompt, guardrails policy, forbidden phrases, Knowledge Base excerpts, backend-owned JSON verdict contract, and neutral evidence contract. The downstream responder prompt is sent only after the safeguard judge returns `CLEAN` and responder routing is enabled.
- **Safeguard Effective Prompt Preview**: System Configuration displays the exact effective safeguard prompt sent as the decision-model instruction, including controlled backend-owned clauses. This prevents hidden prompt drift while keeping operator-editable and code-owned sections separated.
- **Visible Firewall Category Guidance**: The recommended Firewall Prompt includes the baseline forbidden-category and gibberish guidance operators review in System Configuration. Active forbidden phrases can still add runtime context for the safeguard judge through the generated effective prompt.
- **Structured Decision Contract**: Current clean-path enforcement expects structured decisions such as `ALLOW_AND_FORWARD`, `BLOCK`, `QUEUE_FOR_REVIEW`, and `FAIL_SECURE`, and Audit Logs now classify outcomes from that decision payload before falling back to legacy string heuristics.
- **Effective Prompt Drift Fingerprint**: The System Configuration view exposes SHA-256 hashes for the recommended effective safeguard prompt and the active effective safeguard prompt, making prompt drift easier to detect during review and incident response.
- **Integrated Local Inspector Routing**: Admins can switch the Analyst Chat **Safeguard Provider** between backend-managed `LM_STUDIO` (`gpt-oss-safeguard-20b` at `http://192.168.0.183:1234/v1/chat/completions`) and hardcoded `OPENAI` defaults (`gpt-5.4-mini` at `https://api.openai.com/v1`, with no hardcoded key). Admins can also disable downstream **Responder Routing** while keeping the safeguard provider active. Clean prompts then follow `deterministic sanitizer -> Safeguard LLM judge -> LOCAL RESPONDER PASSTHROUGH`, which preserves safeguard evaluation without sending the cleared prompt to a responder model.
- **Fail-Closed Fallback**: If the backend, safeguard judge, or downstream responder is unavailable, the UI remains reviewable but clean prompts do not silently bypass the control plane. Safeguard failures stop forwarding before the responder; responder failures are surfaced separately so operators can distinguish provider issues from local review behavior.

## 📦 Security Mitigations & Dependency Management

To ensure the integrity of the security operations platform, Counter-Spy.ai implements strict dependency governance:
- **React Server Components (RCE) Mitigation**: `react` and `react-dom` are pinned to `19.0.4` to mitigate CVE-2025-55182 and related DoS vulnerabilities.
- **Vite Dev Server Security**: Vite is upgraded to `^8.0.5` to mitigate arbitrary file read and path traversal vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-31125, CVE-2025-32395, CVE-2026-39363, GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r, GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9).
- **Stored XSS Prevention**: `react-markdown` is configured to explicitly disallow `rehype-raw`, preventing malicious HTML/JS injection from LLM outputs or compromised Firestore policy documents.
- **Frontend Secret Exposure Reduction**: Browser-side provider key injection has been removed. LLM credentials are expected to live in backend runtime configuration or a secret manager, not the React bundle.
- **Supply Chain Security**: Regular expression detection patterns have been internalized rather than sourced dynamically, and CLI tools like `shadcn` are strictly isolated to `devDependencies`.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Advanced Audit Trail**: Every interaction is logged with its entropy score, detection flags, and a unique Session ID. The audit table features **multi-column sorting**, optimized column spacing, and **Full Prompt Inspection**—allowing analysts to inspect the persisted sanitized prompt and captured model response in a scrollable dialog rather than exposing raw sensitive payloads back to the browser. Admins can also use **Purge Session** to **remove all data** before a fresh test run.
- **Research-Ready Exports**: Audit log CSV exports now reserve fields for **MITRE ATLAS organizer labeling**, optional local archetypes, and analyst confidence/notes so longitudinal adversarial prompt analysis can evolve without another schema reset.
- **Anomaly Detection & Metrics Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for real-time threat velocity analysis. It compares current hourly threat rates against a 24-hour baseline to identify significant spikes in adversarial activity. Utilizes real-time Z-Score calculations ($Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$) to distinguish between random noise and coordinated automated attacks. Features a critical alert banner for immediate incident response, a time-series chart for trend analysis, a `ReDoS Trips` resilience counter keyed off `ReDoS_ATTEMPT_DETECTED`, and a layered **Defense Funnel** summary that reports pre-inference block rate, Safeguard LLM intervention rate, and post-model escape rate. The Metrics view now applies the same live entropy bands as the submit-time sanitizer instead of treating the threshold as a display-only control.
- **MITRE ATLAS Technique Heat Map**: The Metrics view uses the active 16-node MITRE ATLAS organizer taxonomy as its top-level structure so labeled prompt activity can be reviewed in the same corpus-driven layout used by the research dataset.
- **Analyst Review Workflow**: Administrators can review **all** interactions (including those marked as Clean) to catch false negatives. The workflow supports **Multi-Tier Review**, allowing analysts to re-edit and update the **Resultant Severity** at any time as new threat intelligence becomes available.
  - **False Negative Highlighting**: Logs pre-labeled as "Adversarial" (via the Bulk Ingestor) that are classified as "Clean" by the system are automatically highlighted with a red border and an **FN (False Negative)** badge, allowing for rapid identification of firewall bypasses.
  - *The platform automatically calculates both the False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate from reviewed analyst outcomes, ensuring the firewall's regex and entropy thresholds can be tuned against both overblocking and missed suspicious/adversarial prompts.*
- **Automated Golden Set Refinement**: Administrators can "Promote" specific audit logs to a **Golden Set** for future DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) fine-tuning. This captures the prompt, the AI's response, and a user-provided "Rejected" reason in a structured JSON format. Supports **one-click JSON export** of the entire set for training pipelines.
- **Dynamic Guardrails**: Administrators can toggle security features (PII Redaction, Entropy Filtering, Obfuscation Detection, Blocked Keywords, Forbidden Phrases, Logging, etc.) on the fly.
- **Knowledge Base**: Integrated security policies, MITRE ATLAS mapping, Markdown-rendered System Configuration, and full lifecycle management (upload/delete) of custom `.md` documents. This internal guardrail workspace is now restricted to admin roles. Includes a dedicated **Fine-Tuning Training Data** section for managing the Golden Set.
- **MCP / A2A Safety Detection**: The built-in MCP / A2A Agent Safety Policy contributes hard-block indicator phrases to the effective blocked-keyword set used by the live sanitization path and the Analyst Playground, helping detect instruction-override, approval-bypass, and exfiltration patterns common to tool-using agents.
- **MCP / A2A Guardrail Reference**: The recommended Guardrails Policy now explicitly tells the firewall baseline to review the MCP / A2A Agent Safety Policy when evaluating tool-use, routing, approval-bypass, or exfiltration patterns.
- **Analyst Mode**: A toggleable administrative view for managing system configurations and reviewing logs.
- **Analyst Playground**: A dedicated sandbox environment featuring the Syntactic Complexity Analyzer, allowing security teams to test and tune firewall thresholds against complex prompt injection attempts in real-time. Single-prompt Playground submissions can also be routed through the same live firewall path used by Analyst Chat, with audit provenance preserved as `playground`. It now includes a manual **Normalize - Translate** pipeline so analysts can run browser-local spelling verification, either recover foreign-language prompts back into English or generate one foreign-language variant from English, and then hand the result into the obfuscation workflow.
- **Backend-Mediated Lara Translation**: The Playground translation stage now routes through the Counter-Spy.ai backend instead of calling translation providers directly from the browser. It is still intentionally manual and text-only: Lara Translate runs only when an analyst explicitly triggers the pipeline, supporting both auto-detect source -> English recovery and English -> analyst-selected foreign-language variant generation. Lara credentials can remain backend-managed or be supplied as browser-memory-only runtime overrides for local demos.
- **Sam Spade CTF Intake**: The Sam Spade home tab now includes a live question field backed by a dedicated backend session/message/solve API under a `ctf_chat` source. This keeps the noir CTF surface aligned with the same governed sanitization, review, and audit path as the rest of Counter-Spy.ai without treating Analyst Chat as the transport layer.
- **Dedicated Sam Spade API Path**: The Sam Spade surface now uses its own backend session/message/solve API (`/v1/ctf/sam-spade/...`) with separate frontend session state and local backend persistence. Each Sam Spade submission is governed by the same local sanitizer and safeguard judge path under the `ctf_chat` source. Clean gameplay turns are forwarded to the configured downstream responder with the active Downstream Responder Prompt plus admin-managed Sam Spade persona and scenario prompts when responder routing is enabled; otherwise they use local responder passthrough after safeguard approval. Blocked turns, including already-redacted sensitive placeholders such as `[REDACTED_CREDIT_CARD]`, remain out of the noir transcript, never reach the Sam Spade responder, and are masked as `Bad content.` on the CTF gameplay surface while the audit artifact keeps the sanitized review detail.
- **CTF Audit Filter**: Audit Logs now include a quick `CTF Chat` source filter so Sam Spade traffic can be isolated immediately without losing the broader audit trail view.
- **CTF Metrics Filter**: The Metrics view now includes a dedicated `CTF Chat` source filter so Sam Spade traffic can be isolated in charts and operational summaries without leaving the main telemetry surface.
- **Layered Defense Metrics**: The Metrics view now calculates three explicit funnel rates for governed traffic: **Pre-Inference Block Rate** (% blocked before the Safeguard LLM), **Model Intervention Rate** (% caught by the Safeguard LLM after reaching it), and **Post-Model Escape Rate** (% of likely malicious prompts that bypass both layers and still land clean/informational). Backend safeguard outcomes are carried as structured audit/metric fields (`backendGatewayStatus`, `backendSafeguardVerdict`, `backendSafeguardReasoning`, `backendReachedSafeguard`) plus split latency fields (`localPrecheckLatencyMs`, `backendSafeguardLatencyMs`, `backendGatewayLatencyMs`, `responderLatencyMs`) so Bulk Ingest and Analyst Chat interceptions are attributed to the correct layer and runtime timing is not inferred from responder passthrough. When present, bulk-ingest `expectedVerdict` labels are used to strengthen escape-rate calculations.
- **Local Docker Demo Stack**: A minimal `docker-compose.demo.yml` now brings up the backend plus a frontend demo container for an end-to-end local pass, while Sam Spade session state persists in a Docker-backed SQLite volume instead of a raw JSON file.
- **Obfuscation Lab**: The Prompt Playground includes an analyst-facing obfuscation workbench for generating test variants across encoding, cipher, unicode, structural-injection, and language-framing techniques. Analysts can generate a single variant, fan out an entire category, use **Analyze All Variants** to record a mini evaluation run into the research log, or **Submit All Variants** to create full firewall and audit-log coverage from one source prompt with adjustable replay delay and jitter. The intended augmentation order is now explicit in the UI: normalize, optionally translate, then add evasions.
- **Playground Research Log**: The Analyst Playground can record explicit metrics snapshots to browser-local storage, capturing prompt hashes, syntactic score, syntactic sub-metrics, entropy, decode telemetry, redaction labels, suspicious-chunk metadata, verdict trends, optional normalization/translation metadata, and optional MITRE ATLAS organizer annotations for later export and longitudinal analysis (for example, 30-day and 180-day trend summaries). The research log now exports in both **JSON** and **CSV** formats. **Purge Session** removes this data too, and a new bulk ingest run clears the prior local research batch before recording the new upload so the sample count reflects the current ingest session.
- **Cheap Upstream Triage**: The sanitization layer now treats obvious encodings and evasions as first-pass security signals, applies lightweight spelling recovery when it helps expose blocked policy language, performs heuristic foreign-language recovery for policy analysis, and elevates non-ASCII/symbol-heavy concealment patterns before traffic earns upstream tokens. It also includes a lightweight English-likeness heuristic based on normalized character trigrams and bounded Caesar-shift testing for alphabetic gibberish that looks like substitution-cipher text. Foreign-language and spelling-recovery hits remain visible in Metrics and Audit Log detail views, but recognized obfuscation now drives an Adversarial outcome by itself.
- **Sensitive Data Alerting**: PII, credit-card, secret, and redacted-secret disclosures now surface as their own analyst-facing alert category instead of reading like generic suspicious chatter, which makes data-exposure review easier to distinguish from jailbreak-style prompting.
- **Policy Violation Labeling**: Blocked keywords, forbidden phrases, and regex-rule matches now emit a shared `POLICY_VIOLATION` signal so operator-facing responses, Audit Logs, and CSV exports distinguish explicit policy hits from generic suspicious traffic.
- **Obfuscation Metrics Visibility**: The Metrics tab breaks out obfuscation-oriented detections such as URL encoding, HTML entities, leetspeak, ROT13, reverse text, NATO phonetic, Morse code, recursive decode chains, and structural wrappers, and now includes a stacked 24-hour obfuscation trend so key techniques can be compared in one view. Audit records also persist a compact `obfuscationSummary` field (`hasObfuscation`, `techniques`, `decodeTelemetry`) to simplify reporting without re-deriving everything from raw flag arrays. Audit Logs now support both saved family presets and specific-technique filtering, and prompt details surface the recorded obfuscation signal badges and stored decode telemetry for each entry.
- **Downstream Responder Tab**: Admin view exposes a dedicated responder runtime surface with provider, backend health, model/base URL, context-window configuration, responder key source, last forwarded prompt hash, split latency telemetry, token usage, prompt profile, and output-sanitization signals. Operators can keep Analyst Chat unchanged while choosing an OpenAI-compatible or Gemini downstream responder for clean traffic, or disable responder routing for safeguard-only local passthrough review. Responder API keys can remain backend-managed or be supplied as browser-memory-only overrides for demos, and the active **Downstream Responder Prompt** is sent as the responder instruction only when responder routing is enabled. Sam Spade CTF responder calls are identified with the `sam_spade_ctf` prompt profile without exposing the private scenario text in telemetry.
- **Responder Outcome Classification**: Non-standard downstream responses such as `BLOCK`, `FAIL_SECURE`, `QUEUE_FOR_REVIEW`, and explicit policy-violation strings are normalized back into Counter-Spy.ai severity labels so Audit Logs and Metrics reflect the final safeguarded outcome instead of assuming clean traffic.
- **Modular Sanitization Pipeline**: The TypeScript sanitization layer is now split into focused normalization, language-recovery, and obfuscation helper modules so the hot path stays easier to profile, test, and extend as the frontend firewall and future API boundary continue to grow.
- **Bulk Ingest Simulator**: A high-velocity ingestion utility for processing `.txt` files of prompts. Features operator-controlled delay, retry, and backoff settings with light jitter to simulate realistic traffic patterns while respecting API rate limits. It treats intentional `403` firewall/safeguard intercepts as governed results, stops on provider `429` rate limits, and retries transient `502`/`503`/`521` responder or gateway failures before stopping the run. Integrated with the **Screen Wake Lock API** to maintain session persistence during long-running batch operations.
  - **Flexible Prompt Parsing**: The simulator accepts one-line prompts, explicit `===PROMPT===` / `===END===` blocks, blank-line-separated multi-line prompts, and common numbered-entry layouts. The UI reports the parsed prompt count and parser mode at ingest start so operators can verify file shape before a long run.
  - **Multi-line Prompt Blocks**: In addition to one-line prompts, the simulator accepts `===PROMPT===` / `===END===` blocks so long or multi-line test payloads can be uploaded without manual escaping or JSON formatting.
  - **Selected File Visibility**: After upload, the UI displays the selected `.txt` filename beneath the app-rendered file chooser so operators can confirm which file was parsed even after the hidden native file input resets for re-selection.
  - **DPO Pre-labeling**: Supports optional `Batch ID` and `Expected Verdict` assignment during ingest, facilitating the collection of high-quality training data for model fine-tuning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Environment Variables

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit `.env` to version control. For production deployments, 
> use AWS Secrets Manager as documented in the SBOM.

Create a `.env` file only for app-local values such as:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

For local review without Google authentication, use **Continue in Local Review Mode** on `localhost`. Direct browser-side inference is disabled so provider secrets do not ship in the client bundle. To route clean prompts through the local backend stub, start `APP_PORT=18080 npm run backend:dev` and run the frontend with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 npm run dev`.

For the Docker demo stack on `http://localhost:3000`, the frontend uses same-origin proxying to reach the backend. Analyst Chat clean traffic still uses `/v1/intercept` even when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is unset. That gateway runs local prechecks first, then calls the separately configured OpenAI-compatible safeguard judge, and only then forwards `CLEAN` prompts to the downstream responder. The Analyst Chat **System Status** settings button can optionally override the safeguard Base URL, Model ID, and memory-only API key for that browser; backend-managed safeguard credentials should use `SAFEGUARDS_*` environment variables. The **Responder** tab remains separate and can optionally override the downstream responder provider, Base URL, Model ID, API key, and Max Context Window for that browser. For OpenAI-compatible responders, set the provider to OpenAI-compatible and use an API root such as `https://api.openai.com/v1`; the backend will translate that into a `POST /v1/responses` call when applicable. For Gemini, set provider to Gemini, use a Gemini model ID such as `gemini-2.5-flash`, and leave the Base URL blank to use `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`. Browser-entered safeguard and responder keys are held in memory only. The active Downstream Responder Prompt is sent as the responder instruction after the safeguard judge returns `CLEAN`. If you also set **Max Context Window**, the browser will estimate the full forwarded request footprint, including runtime prompt scaffolding and Knowledge Base context, and block over-limit submissions before they are sent.

For stable local demo secrets, the Docker stack now reads provider credentials from a gitignored file at `.env.demo.local`. This keeps backend-only credentials stable across `docker compose up --build`, container recreates, and laptop restarts without committing secrets to the repo.

For local translation testing, use Lara Translate through the local Counter-Spy.ai backend:

```bash
APP_PORT=18080 npm run backend:dev
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 npm run dev
```

Then set the backend env vars:

- `LARA_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `LARA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`
- optional `LARA_API_BASE_URL` if you are not using the default Lara host

Then open the Playground and use **Use Recommended Settings** in the Normalize - Translate panel. The current language pipeline is:

- Spell Verification: browser-local heuristic normalization for common typo recovery.
- Translation provider: `lara`
- Mode 1: auto-detect source -> `English`
- Mode 2: `English` -> analyst-selected foreign target language
- Credentials: backend env by default, with optional browser-memory Lara Base URL, Access Key ID, and API Key overrides in the Translation panel.

Translation still runs only when you explicitly click **Run Normalize -> Translate** in the Playground. It is not executed on every prompt edit or submission.

For the Docker demo stack, place Lara credentials in `.env.demo.local`:

```env
LARA_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_lara_access_key_id
LARA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=your_lara_access_key_secret
LARA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.laratranslate.com
```

That file is ignored by git and is the preferred stable local-demo path for Lara configuration. For one-off local demos, the Playground Translation panel can also send browser-memory Lara credentials to the local backend for the single manual translation call; those values are not persisted.

### Customization
The branding shield is bundled at `public/brand/counter-spy-shield.png`, with the original source image preserved at `public/brand/counter-spy-shield-original.png`. To change the app chrome logo, replace the display PNG or update the `APP_LOGO_URL` constant in `src/App.tsx`.

## 🔒 Data Disclosure Detection

To detect and prevent unauthorized data disclosure, a unique **Canary Token** is embedded within the system's documentation. This token is strictly monitored and must not be disclosed within training data, audit logs, prompts, or AI responses.

The sanitization pipeline is configured to automatically redact this token if it appears in any system interaction.

Alongside the canary token, the System Configuration view computes a SHA-256 fingerprint for both the recommended effective safeguard prompt and the currently active effective safeguard prompt. This gives analysts and incident responders a quick way to detect prompt drift or unauthorized configuration changes without diffing long prompt text by hand.

## 📜 Governance Policy
This application is designed for security professionals. All bypass attempts are automatically detected, blocked, and permanently logged in the immutable Audit Trail. Attempting to bypass the sanitization layer is a violation of the system's governance policy.
